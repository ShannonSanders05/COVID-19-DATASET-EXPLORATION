## Project Title: COVID-19-Dataset-Exploration

**Description:**

In this SQL project, I conducted a thorough exploratory analysis utilizing deaths and vaccination data tables related to COVID-19, spanning from March 2020 to June 2021. I executed a variety of SQL queries, ranging from basic to advanced, on the locally downloaded raw dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. 

I aimed to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset, contributing to a deeper understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 fatalities and vaccination efforts.
